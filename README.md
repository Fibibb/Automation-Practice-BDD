## About Page

Automation Pracitce is a site dedicated to automation testing and manual testing. On the site we can find such functionalities as browsing products, working with a shopping cart, going through all stages of sales, working with social media and much more.

## Goal

The main goal was to learn good practices for writing test cases. This resulted in thirty test cases in six different sections. This was enough to cover some of the negative cases and all the positive ones.
